# Info #
Fork of Beyond Earth modified for the <a href="https://orbita.renovamenia.com">Orbita</a> modpack.

This page is not affiliated with the Beyond Earth team, but we thank them for making this mod.

# Changes #
✕ = Not implemented, ✓ = Implemented, P = Partially Implemented
* Entities on Venus and Mercury only burn if they are exposed to the sky. [✓]
* Water is placeable on Venus and Mercury if it is not exposed to the sky and is below Y70. [✓]
* Brighter Moon Sand, Moon Stone and Moon Stone Brick textures. [✓]
* Space stations will generate at Y160 instead of Y100, and not be created if there are blocks between Y155 and Y175 at the player's X, Z coordinate. [✓]
* Smaller space station structure and updated recipe. [✓]
* Removal of all orbit dimensions besides "earth_orbit" which is renamed to "orbit". [✓]
* Addition of asteroid belt, asteroids are made of deepslate and can contain most ores (zinc will generate here if Create is installed). [✓]
* Integration for visiting select other mods' dimensions via rocket. [✕] 
* Gravity rework, some planetoid gravities changed, weightlessness in 0G dimensions is simulated (with a mag-boot-like effect if an entity is standing on or beside a block) [✓]
* Entities falling from orbit enter at Y700 instead of Y450. [✓]
* Entities who move above Y700 in the overworld will be moved to orbit. All other planetoid dimensions will disallow players from going higher than this. [✓]
* Entities who are above Y590 in planetoid dimensions will be in "low orbit", and have all the effects of being in orbit such as lack of gravity and oxygen. [✓]
* Entities between Y levels 590 and 320 in planetoid dimensions will have lessened gravity to simulate gradually de-orbiting. [✓]
* Elytra will not work in dimensions without an atmosphere. [✓]
* New items and blocks; Sulphur ore, dust and block (spawns on Venus, used to make gunpowder), carbon block and chunk (spawns in asteroids, compressed into diamonds). [✓]

# Info #
Page for making small changes to the Beyond Earth mod so it fits in better with the vision of the Orbita server's modpack. This will likely not stay up to date with the source repo and will not be updated every version, you should download it from the official repo unless these changes appeal to you. This page is not affiliated with the Beyond Earth team in any way, but many thanks to them for making this great mod.

# Planned Changes #
✕ = Not implemented, ✓ = Implemented, P = Partially Implemented
* Entities on Venus and Mercury only burn if they are exposed to the sky. [✓]
* Water is placable on Venus and Mercury if it is not exposed to the sky. [✕]
* Space stations will not be created if there is already a block at the creation point. [✕]
* Removal of all orbit dimensions besides "earth_orbit" which is renamed to "orbit". [✓]
* Addition of asteroid belt, functions as a mining dimension. [P]
* Entities in orbit and the asteroid belt will have no gravity and players will be able to move around freely in a slowed creative flight, except when their feet are directly above or beside blocks (this is to simulate a "mag-boot" effect). [✕]
* Players falling from orbit enter at Y700 instead of Y450. [✓]
* Players who move above Y700 in the overworld will be moved to orbit. All other dimensions will disallow players from going higher than this. [✕]
* Players who are above Y590 will be in "low orbit", and have all the effects of being in orbit such as lack of gravity and oxygen. [P]
* Players between Y levels 590 and 320 will have the Slow Falling effect to simulate a gradual de-orbiting. [✕]
* Entity (when standing on blocks) and item gravity are significantly reduced in orbit dimensions. [P]

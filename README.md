# Planned Changes #
✕ = Not implemented, ✓ = Implemented, P = Partially Implemented
* Entities on Venus and Mercury only burn if they are exposed to the sky. [✓]
* Water is placeable on Venus and Mercury if it is not exposed to the sky and is below Y70. [✓]
* Brighter Moon Sand, Moon Stone and Moon Stone Brick textures. [✓]
* Space stations will generate at Y160 instead of Y100, and not be created if there are blocks between Y155 and Y175 at the player's X, Z coordinate. [✓]
* Smaller space station structure and updated recipe. [✓]
* Removal of all orbit dimensions besides "earth_orbit" which is renamed to "orbit". [✓]
* Addition of asteroid belt, asteroids are made of deepslate and can contain most ores (the lander will check for a safe spot to land, you will never fall into the void). [✓]
* Zero gravity dimensions are true zero G, players can move around similar to (slower) creative flight, and fall to structures that are 1 block below them in a 3x3 area (like having mag-boots) [✓]
* Players falling from orbit enter at Y700 instead of Y450. [✓]
* Players who move above Y700 in the overworld will be moved to orbit. All other dimensions will disallow players from going higher than this. [✕]
* Players who are above Y590 will be in "low orbit", and have all the effects of being in orbit such as lack of gravity and oxygen. [✓]
* Players between Y levels 590 and 320 will have the Slow Falling effect to simulate a gradual de-orbiting. [✕]
* Entities above Y590 will take oxygen damage if not wearing a suit. [✓]
* Elytras are unusable on worlds with no atmosphere. [✕]
